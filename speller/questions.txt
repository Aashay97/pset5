0.  pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is the longest word in this pset's(and any major) dictionary.
    It has been coined for a disease of the lung.
1.  getrusage returns resource usage statistics(like memory used and cpu time) for a calling process,its descendents or the calling thread.
2.  16 members.
3.  We pass by reference because passing the entire structures would lead to wastage of time and resources.
4.  fgetc not only returns an unsigned int but also updates the file pointer to the next character.
    We are using the for loop to continually get character after character and then decide what to
    do with each of them singly. If the character is either an alphabet or an apostrophe, we store
    it in the array(word). If the word length turns out to be greater than 45 or if the character 
    is a number, we ignore the word and restart for the next word with index=0 passing over all 
    characters that aren't the aforementioned. Now, once a word is completed, we end it with a \0
    (as for a string) and update the counter. We now check the word for misspellings. If the word 
    is misspelled, it is printed and the misspellings counter is incremented. This entire process
    is repeated till we reach the EOF.
5.  fscanf will take in everything until we reach a space. Thus the output string could be longer 
    than 45(we would be going out of bounds of the array). It may also contain commas, full stops
    and digits which we do not want.
6.  We want to make sure that the parameters aren't changed erroneously within the function i.e.
    they need to be a constant.
